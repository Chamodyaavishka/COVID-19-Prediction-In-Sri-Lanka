Objective:
This project aims to analyze the trend of COVID-19 cases over time and predict future case numbers using statistical modeling. The focus is on the progression of the pandemic within a specific region (likely Sri Lanka, as suggested by the dataset title).

Data and Analysis:

The dataset titled COVID-19 SL 03-11 to 03-24.csv contains daily cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases.
The data is processed and visualized to show the number of COVID-19 cases from March 11th to March 24th.
Initial data visualization includes plotting the actual cumulative case counts over this period.
Model Development:

A polynomial regression model is utilized to fit the existing data points, allowing for the prediction of future case trends based on the established pattern.
The model is trained on the data from March 11th to March 24th, and predictions are made for subsequent days.
Predictions:

The predictions are visualized alongside the actual data to compare the model's performance.
Future case numbers are forecasted, extending beyond the last date of actual data, providing insights into potential case developments if current trends continue.
Tools and Technologies:

Python programming language, primarily using libraries such as NumPy for data manipulation, Pandas for data handling, and Matplotlib for data visualization.
Scikit-learn for implementing the polynomial regression model.
Outcome:

The model provides a visual representation of the expected versus actual case numbers, serving as a tool for understanding and projecting the spread of the virus.
Such predictions can be instrumental for public health planning and response strategies.
